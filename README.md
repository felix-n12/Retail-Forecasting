This project is a retail forecasting application that predicts the demand for various beverage retail products for company XYZ. It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze historical sales data, external factors, and trends to provide accurate sales forecasts.

## Business Objectives
1. The main objective is to forecast accurate sales
2. To determine the product with the most sales
3. To determine which holiday has the most sales
4. To determine which month has the most sales

## Project Overview
Business Understanding: Exploring the business reasons for our data mining effort and what the company hopes to gain from the project. This is done by attempting to answer the objectives laid down.

Data Understanding: The datasets we utilized comprised of 1 dataset that has 12 columns and 1218 rows.

Data Preparation: It mainly involved; selecting the data to discover the columns to be used, cleaning the data to correct and remove erroneous values, formatting the data to effectively perform mathematical operations.

Exploratory Data Analysis: The goal of this procedure is to summarize the main characteristics of the dataset, which is often done visually.

Modelling: To further support and provide insight we used various models;ARIMA,ARIMAX,SARIMA,SARIMAX,Facebook Prophet.

Evaluation: The Project success criteria will be a forecast accuracy of 90% meaning that the forecast error is than 10% of the actual sales.

Recommendation and Conclusion: It mainly involved interpreting our project findings, offering opinions based on the findings, proposing a solution to the gap discovered in the research that needs to be filled, and the next steps to be undertaken in future analysis
